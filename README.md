## Required programs

- [node v22](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [pnpm v10](https://pnpm.io/)

## Scripts

### pnpm install

Install required dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

### pnpm dev

Run the dev server:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

### pnpm lint, pnpm format, pnpm check

Check for linting errors and apply safe fixes:

```sh
pnpm lint
```

Check for formatting errors and apply safe fixes:

```sh
pnpm format
```

Do both in one check:

```sh
pnpm check
```

### Testing

Install required browsers for running e2e tests:

```sh
pnpm e2e:install
```

Run all tests:

```sh
pnpm e2e:test
```

Use the `ui` flag to watch the tests:

```sh
pnpm exec playwright test --ui
```

Run tests for individual browsers:

| Google Chrome | Firefox | Safari |
| --- | --- | --- |
|`pnpm e2e:test:chromium`|`pnpm e2e:test:firefox`|`pnpm e2e:test:webkit`|

Generate tests interactively:

```sh
pnpm e2e:test:generate
```

Read more in the [docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen).

### Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
pnpm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

## File structure

- `dashboard/`: root folder with configuration files and subfolders
  - `.github/`: GitHub config like CI/CD workflows and PR templates
  - `.react-router/`: autogenerated types from React Router
  - `.vscode/`: Local per user workspace settings for those using VSCode
  - `build/`: Build artifacts for deploying the app to servers
  - `public/`: Assets requiring no processing, clients download these files as is.
  - `src/`: All source code for the web app
    - `components/`: Common components used in multiple pages. Encapsulates features into singular units.
      - `ui`: Primitives acting as the foundational building blocks for composing larger features or sections, for example common layout components like headers, footers and sidebars, or features like a login modal. Most primitives originates from shadcn/ui and might be manually tweaked to our preferences.
    - `hooks/`: Common React hooks reused in multiple pages
    - `lib/`: Common code reused in multiple pages
    - `pages/`: Page components rendered by our router. This includes common layouts and should try to reflect either the routing or grouping of responsibilities as close as possible. If the component uses router apis, then it should most likely lie here.
      - `__tests__/`: End-to-end tests for full pages or user stories
    - `index.css`: Style variables accessable throughout the whole app. Mainly configuration of Tailwind and CSS variables.
    - `root.tsx`: Root HTML rendered for ALL pages. Contains global metadata, styles and providers.
    - `routes.ts`: Routing declared through the React Router routes API. Check out the [docs](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/routing) for an in-depth explanation of the API.
